READ ME!

Straight out the gate, a couple things that could have been done better.

1. The lack of a mobile view for the project.
2. The endpoints did not return a unique id for the fields so that made navigation and singular data fetching somewhat tricky.
3. The lack of pagination.
4. On the screens that render details about a singular entity (person, specie), instead of having multiple components cater to each one, I could just have easily used on component and passed the content as props, but then thinking from a scaling perspective,that might not have the right long term outcome.
5. You might also need to clear your cookies when you run this(shouldn't be a problem anyway), i made use of an email field in ascertaining whether a person should have access to non-auth pages (see middleware.ts).
6. Finally, My sister gave birth the day of my first interview so I had to put this together quickly so I can have a bit of family time. Thank you for the congrats by the way.
7. Finally, Again, Nothing else to add. cheers.
